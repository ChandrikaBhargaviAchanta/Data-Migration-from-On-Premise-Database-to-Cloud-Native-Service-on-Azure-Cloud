# Data-Migration-from-On-Premise-Database-to-Cloud-Native-Service-on-Azure-Cloud
**Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a reliable and scalable method for migrating critical business data to the cloud. The focus is on leveraging Azure Data Factory as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool to facilitate seamless data migration while addressing key concerns such as encryption, architecture, and the migration of database objects.
