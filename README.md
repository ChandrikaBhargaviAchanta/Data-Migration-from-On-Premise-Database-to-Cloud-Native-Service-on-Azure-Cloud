# Data-Migration-from-On-Premise-Database-to-Cloud-Native-Service-on-Azure-Cloud
### Objective  
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a reliable and scalable method for migrating critical business data to the cloud. The focus is on leveraging Azure Data Factory as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool to facilitate seamless data migration while addressing key concerns such as encryption, architecture, and the migration of database objects.  


### Key Features
_Data Migration Strategy:_  
Implemented a comprehensive migration strategy, including proof of concept, to ensure the successful transfer of data with minimal impact on business operations.  

_Encryption & Data Security:_  
Analyzed and implemented encryption techniques to safeguard sensitive data during the migration process, ensuring compliance with industry standards.  

_ETL Process:_  
Utilized Azure Data Factory to extract, transform, and load data from on-premise Oracle databases to Azure SQL Managed Instances, incorporating advanced pipelines for scalability and efficiency.  

_Database Object Migration:_  
Addressed the migration of database objects like Stored Procedures, Triggers, and Functions, using SQL Server Managed Assistance (SSMA) to streamline the conversion process.  

_Architecture Implementation:_  
Designed both basic and advanced pipeline architectures to optimize the migration process, featuring master, parallel, and base pipelines to handle large-scale data transfers.  


### Technology Stack 
**_Cloud Platform:_** Microsoft Azure (SQL Managed Instance, Azure Data Factory)  
**_Database Systems:_** Oracle, SQL Server  
**_Programming & Scripting:_** SQL, PowerShell  
**_Tools_:** SQL Server Managed Assistance (SSMA), Azure Portal  


### Conclusion  
This project underscores the importance of a well-planned and executed data migration strategy in the era of cloud computing. By utilizing Azure Data Factory, the migration process becomes not only efficient but also secure, allowing businesses to harness the power of the cloud with confidence. The lessons learned from this project are applicable to any organization looking to modernize its data infrastructure while ensuring business continuity.
